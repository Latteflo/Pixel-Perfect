# Pixel-Perfect

Welcome to the Pixel Perfect repository! This project is a endeavor to recreate user interfaces with extreme precision and attention to detail. For each interface, the goal is to make it as close to the original as possible - pixel perfect!

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by interfaces, with each one residing in its own dedicated folder. The folder name corresponds to the number of the interface (e.g., Interface 17).

## Live Demo and Original Image

For each recreated interface, I will provide a link to the live version, a printscreen of my version, as well as the original image for comparison. These links will be updated here as and when new interfaces are added.
